I have known the arcane lore
On strange roads such visions met
That I have no fear nor concern
For hatred and obstacles of this world
By stone-shoed wanderer I am taught
My visions from fiery-eyed iron-armed chanter
I know how to fight
I know how to sing
I know how to bend
I know how to break
How to break
How to break
I've not grown weary on lengthy roads
On strange lands not gone astray
Such is the knowledge
Knowledge cast in me
Such is the knowledge
Such are the skills
I know how to fight
I know how to sing
I know the way
